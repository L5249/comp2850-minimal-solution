# Week 6 Interview notes

## Participant A
**Date**: [2025-11-15 13:52]
**Context**: Only uses mobile
**Consent**: Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: 7 minutes 

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: I rarely use a task manager but I often use the iphone notes app to track my day to day tasks. I have to make multiple note folders and pages to keep my notes organised. Task managers are ok but for any good ones on mobile they all cost money. I do find that i can just open it and jot something down quickly if needed though.

**Observations**:
- Often a jumbled mess of lots of folders and files that could easily get lost if not kept on top of
- super quick and easy 

**Themes**: `messy`, `organisation`, `efficiency`, `mobile`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: Half the time the list gets so big that I forget which tasks are most important so I end up forgetting to do some tasks. I also have to write which ones should have proity, I have no way of marking them automaticall when I add a note.

**Observations**:
- No filtering
- No sense of importancy 
- Too unorganised

**Themes**: `unorganised`, `jumbled`

---

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: All the time, unfortunately qith so many files and folder when I have tasks that need to be completed but are not as important they tend to get lost.

**Observations**:
- Priorotisation needed
- lists need to be separated

**Themes**: `prioritisation`, `separation`

---

### Q4: Work without a mouse?
**Response**: I only use it on mobile so yes, I have never tried to use it without a mouse on my laptop.

**Observations**:
- Mobile can be a friendly way to accomodate people with no mouse ext. 

**Themes**: `mobile`, `user friendly`

---

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: In sunlight the blackbackground with white text stands out really well, I have never tried with my eyes closed. with my eyes closed though I would assume that it would would be very difficult because you would be able to see what you are clicking or typing. 

**Observations**:
- contrast is good, light text on dark background
- using a mobile notes app is not good for when you can't see

**Themes**: `contrast`, `brightness`, `mobile`

---

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: A system that allows for task prioritisation so I can quickly filter through taks of different levels of priority. 

**Observations**:
-prioritisation allows for much more efficient task management.

**Themes**: -`priority` `efficiency` 

---

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. too jumbled, list gets too long
2. lose track of important tasks. 
3. mobile only(rarely computer)


**Job story ideas**:
- "When I add a task, I want them to be filterable by priority so the user can manage their tasks more efficiently."
- "When I read my tasks, I want them to stand out with a great contrast so I'm not straining my eyes when trying to read tasks"
- "When I scroll through my tasks, I want them to be super organised, with different tags(priority, what the task links to, is it an event ect) so that I can easily find all my tasks and a task will never get lost."



## Participant B
**Date**: [2025-11-15 14:15]
**Context**: Uses keyboard, mouse with two monitors, prefers light mode
**Consent**: Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [12 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "I tend not to use a task manager for personal things, but last time I did I used Trello to organise a group project and I found that it worked considerably well for colaboration and organisation"

**Observations**:
- Task managers are great for working as a team, if you have one that allows for collaboration 
- task managers need to be organised well enough so that large group problems are easily solvable
- personal task managers may not be hugely neccessary to some people

**Themes**: `collaborate`, `organised`, `break_down`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "When working, I feel like there should be some hierarchical structure, for instance one main task, with sub tasks and the card should have a progress bar of how many sub tasks have been completed." (Me: "So why is this frustrating?") "Once task get slightly too complex it just turns into one massive task list for one task, where things aren't truely broken down so progress can't be tracked as clearly. Also when I make any changes, I don't get any feedback when the task is added updated ext,I would like some confirmation. "

**Observations**:
- Lack of structure
- Organisation on large tasks can slip
- editing task need some sort of confirmation so the user knows that the action is actually completed. 

**Themes**: `subtasks`, `organisation`, `structure`, `confirmation`

---

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "I wouldn't say completely forgotten, but they have definitely got buried when the task got big so they we were caught by suprise when reviewing the things left to do."

**Observations**:
- Large tasks can cause items to go missing
- A better way to organise task, maybe an incomplete task filtering system?
- Consequence = in team meeting some tasks cause suprises as they were supposed to be done.

**Themes**: `visibility`, `Large_tasks`, `filtering`

---

### Q4: Work without a mouse?
**Response**: "I have never had to unwillingly use no mouse before, however I wanted to try and improve effiency by learning some shortcuts like in excel. There are a suprising amount of shortcuts in trello which was nice, however using purely just a keyboard with no mouse would definitely not be a smooth experience. Like trying to move a card just doesn't work"

**Observations**:
- Keyboard-only is not smooth, but keyboard shortcuts did improve efficiency
- Tried to speed things up
- Doing more mouse dependent things does not work as well as intended 

**Themes**: `shortcut`, `efficiency`, `mouse_keyboard_inclusive`

---

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "I have never tried, but will try now.(2 mins). That did not work at all, I could not type properly, see which task I was editing and in general just what I was doing. I prefer light mode, but when the sunlight shines on it it means I get terrible glare"

**Observations**:
- "In light mode there is glare with sunlight. Fix: maybe add a toggle?"
- "With eyes closed there needs to be more assistance becasue it just doesn't work"

**Themes**: `contrast`, `assistance`, `toggle_mode`

---

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "As I said earlier, the subtask would be a great feature. It would allow for progress tracking, better organisation, better task delegation"

**Observations**:
- Subtasks open the doors to lots of new things
- see progress of large tasks 
- organistion improvemnt 

**Themes**: `progress`, `subtasks`, `organisation`

---

## Summary (Participant B)
**Top pain points**:
1. lack of subtasks so the tasks become way to big
2. large tasks are unmanagable
3. Keyboard only usage creates slower working 
4. eyes closed uaged doesn't work as accessibility is limited

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I'm creating a large task, I want the option to create multiple sub tasks so I can do the task in easier step and see my progress clearly"
- "When I use only my keyboard, I want every feature to be usable so if any hardware issues arise then I can continue doing my work just as efficiently"
- "When creating my task manager, I want it to be accessible to everyone, so people with disablities are still able to use the app too."
