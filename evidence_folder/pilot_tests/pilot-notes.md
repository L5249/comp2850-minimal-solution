| 16:00:24 | T3 | Participant comments that an “added” confirmation would be helpful. | user-request |

|------|------|-------------|-----|
| 16:13:00 | — | Warm-up: Participant browses interface. Notes that every action causes a full page reload. | warmup |
| 16:13:07 | T3 | First add: task appears after reload, but participant says “I wasn’t sure it worked at first" | missing-feedback |
| 16:13:32 | T3 | Second add: works, but participant comments there is “no pop up or tick to say it’s been added.” | ux-feedback |
| 16:14:05 | T1 | First filter: participant waits through reload, says it “feels sluggish without JavaScript.” | perf-perception |
| 16:14:37 | T1 | Second filter: understands the pattern now, says live filtering would be nicer. | ux-expectation |
| 16:15:12 | T2 | Edit: after reload, nothing changed. “Edit kind of doesn’t work in no JS.” | negative-feedback |
| 16:15:49 | T4 | Delete: task disappears, participant checks list twice, suggests needing an undo or clearer message. | destructive-action |

**Debrief notes:**
- “Without JavaScript it all feels slower and jumpy.”
- “Add and edit both worked, but I really missed a pop up.”
- “Edit in no JS mode felt broken until I stared at the list.”
- “Delete is fine but needs undo feedback.”
